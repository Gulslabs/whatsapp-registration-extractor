- Scan your QR code using your phone; then press enter on the running program
- Messages will start sending automatically.

## Important Notes
- Keep your phone connected to the internet throughout the process.
- Do not close the Chrome window during message sending.
- It's recommended not to send too many messages at once to avoid Whatapps(Meta) blocking your number.

## Applied to Naqeeb Sheet to generate data neeed in contacts.csv
- Formula to extract whatsapp number in `+01 <number>` format. Formula: `="'" & "+91" & TEXT(E4, "0") & "'"`, call this column 'WhatsApp# 2'. Assume its in 'AM4' cell. 
-  Then add Naqeeb Number on column 'AL4'. 
-  Then on column AN4 apply `=AM4 & "," & C4 & "," & AK4 & "," & AL4`. This will generate output as `'+919701567398',Shaik Ishaq,Md Rizwan,+91 81790 23418`; 
- Paste these contains on contacts.csv file and run `send_whatsapp_messages_with_selenium.py`
